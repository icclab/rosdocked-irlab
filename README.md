# Ros2docked

## TL;DR

Run a containerized basic ROS2 foxy environment and novnc for the graphical interface, using docker-compose

	cd ros2docked-irlab
	docker-compose up

Two containers will be started, it will have access to your X server through novnc.

You can access the GUI over a browser using the IP address of your machine and the port number 443
